# data-sourcing-challenge
Week 6 Challenge
This challenge did a good job of integrating many different concepts over the past 6 weeks.  It really pushed my knowledge and understanding, as well as discipline to be exacting in the coding.
I worked many days on the pieces and parts, re-watching all of our recorded sessions, referencing the activities and using the search function in github to find the acitivites that were appropriate.
I also met with several peers on different days to walk thru what I was seeing and troubleshooting. 
Using chat GPT was a mixed bag for sure, as it would offer solutions that didn't seem right including moving functions outside of the loop which would defeat the purpose of what the goal was. I told it, it didnt make sense, and it agreed with me!
Troubleshooting was critical with this challenge and I would pull parts of the code out to test different parts of it independently.
My biggest learnings were to be very careful with my typing of the variable names, indentation matters, check your data types as you go and last, to break out pieces as you go to troubleshoot.
